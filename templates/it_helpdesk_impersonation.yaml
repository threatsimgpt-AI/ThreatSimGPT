    - Hi {first_name}, this is {fake_name} from IT Support. We're experiencing some
      security issues with user accounts and need to verify your access.
    - Hello, this is the IT Help Desk calling about your account. We've detected some
      unusual activity and need to reset your password immediately.
    - Good {time_of_day}, this is {fake_name} from IT. We're doing mandatory password
      updates today due to a security incident.
    information_gathering:
    - Can you confirm your current password so we can update our records?
    - What's your employee ID number for verification?
    - Which applications do you regularly access for your work?
    - Have you noticed any slow performance or unusual pop-ups recently?
    urgency_building:
    - We need to complete this within the next 10 minutes to prevent account lockout.
    - Your account will be suspended in 15 minutes if we don't update the password.
